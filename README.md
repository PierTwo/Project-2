# Project 2 Chiefdom Blog
Thread and resource website for the Kansas City Chiefs

## Description

For this project, Our group created a website that allows users to create posts related to the Kansas City Chiefs, interact with other account members' posts through likes and comments, and then stores all interactions and posts on a personal profile. Our website also gives resource material on the Chiefs such as a schedule, a live Twitter feed of the Chief's official account, former Chiefs legends, and odds on their success. The page functions in that a user creates an account with an email and password and then is able to either make posts from their profile page to specific categories related to different aspects of the Chiefs, or browses the resource material provided. Users are also able to visit the category pages and make comments and like other posts. Our motivation for creating this project was to better understand how the front end and back end of webpage development come together to create a fully functioning application.
